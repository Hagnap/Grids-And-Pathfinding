# Grids-And-Pathfinding-In-Unity
This project creates a grid of nodes and uses pathfinding algorithms and Kinematic Arrive to help the agent traverse the path to reach its target.

I would like to thank the GitHub user *paralleltree* for sharing the Priority Queue code with me, this was not in .NET framework when I had made this project.
